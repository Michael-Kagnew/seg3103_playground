# Lab 3 Objectives
- Running code coverage tools
- Applying white-box coverage techniques 
- Refactoring in systematic steps 
- Continue practice of Git/GitHub

# Jacoco Coverage Analysis
Jacoco is a free code coverage library for Java, and during this lab, we utilized it in the Eclipse IDE. Below are the results for the computation test class, as well as screenshots for the Date class before and after adding test classes and refactoring.

## Computation Code Coverage Metrics

Here are the metrics for the computation code coverage:
